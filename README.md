# Zerops x Filament

WORK IN PROGRESS

[Filament](https://filamentphp.com) is a collection of beautiful full-stack components. This recipe showcasing how to run production version in Zerops. It's based on [Filament Demo](https://github.com/filamentphp/demo) and 
icludes all the advanced functionality â€” session and cache
stored in Redis and files stored in Object Storage, this makes it perfectly suitable for production of any size.

## Deploy on Zerops

You can either click the deploy button to deploy directly on Zerops, or manually copy
the [import yaml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml) to the
import dialog in the Zerops app.

## Recipe features

- Filament running on a load balanced **Zerops PHP + Nginx** service
- Zerops **PostgreSQL 16** service as database
- Zerops KeyDB (**Redis**) service for session and cache
- Zerops **Object Storage** (S3 compatible) service as file system
- Proper setup for Laravel **cache**, **optimization**, and **database migrations**
- Logs set up to use **syslog** and accessible through Zerops GUI
- Utilization of Zerops built-in **environment variables** system

[//]: # (- [Mailpit]&#40;https://github.com/axllent/mailpit&#41; as **SMTP mock server**)
[//]: # (- [Adminer]&#40;https://www.adminer.org&#41; for **quick database management** tool)

<br/>

## Production vs. development

Base of the recipe is ready for production, the difference comes down to:

- Use highly available version of the PostgreSQL database (change `mode` from `NON_HA` to `HA` in recipe YAML, `db`
  service section)
- Use at least two containers for Jetstream service to achieve high reliability and resilience (add `minContainers: 2`
  in recipe YAML, `app` service section)
- Use production-ready third-party SMTP server instead of Mailpit (change `MAIL_` secret variables in recipe YAML `app`
  service)
- Disable public access to Adminer or remove it altogether (remove service `adminer` from recipe YAML)

## Changes made over the default installation

If you want to modify your existing Filament app to efficiently run on Zerops, these are the general steps we
took:

- Add [zerops.yml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops.yml) to your repository, our
  example includes idempotent migrations, caching, and optimized build process
- Setup health check. From Laravel 11 is by default setup by framework.
- Add [league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/composer.json#L14) to
  your composer.json to support Object Storage file system
- Utilize
  Zerops [environment variables](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops.yml#L25-L75)
  and [secrets](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-filament/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml#L12-L16) to
  setup S3 for file system, Redis for cache and sessions, and trusted proxies to work with reverse proxy load balancer
